<p class="post__paragraph--callout">HCPSS Interim Superintendent Michael Martirano put into place a reorganized Central Office, structured to drive his vision for a robust instructional program that ensures equity and enables all students to reach their greatest potential.<p>
<p>The new organization provides a flatter leadership model that fosters cross- and vertical collaboration and opens lines of communication at all levels throughout the school system. With a focus on instruction as a birth-through-graduation continuum, the new structure better positions the school system to address and overcome factors that contribute to the achievement gap.</p>
